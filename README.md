## Problem

Food factories today face a massive challenge: balancing production, storage, and demand. And the result is shocking: in Portugal alone, 1.9 million tons of food are wasted every year.
With this much loss, there’s also a lot of money to be saved — and a lot of people to be helped. This happens due to Limited AI insights, Poor supplier management, Inefficient stock transfers 
and Low personalization.
So we propose Food Oracle, an AI-Powered platform built for predicting profit, and preventing waste.

## Our solution
Our platform contains various AI features that can help everyone:

### Smart Budget Advisor

This chatbot knows everything about the product, the current inventory, the supplier history and his classification. Given that when he reads the quotations PDFs he can give the best advices.

### Logistics Optimizer

This element forecasts the demand for each products in calculated zones and them redistributes them for the warehouses that need the most. Making products available where they are actually needed.

As we can see Proença-a-Nova Distribution Center really needs garlic :D

### Smart Donation Assistant

When inevitable waste happens it's where food oracle shines. We turn waste into worth. We find near expiry products and suggest near NGO's to donate it.

### Seasonal Demand Predictor

We give seasonal forecasts and suggestions

### Automatic Product Quality Checker

When a supplier registers a product AI automatically suggests the best suitable warehouse and detects the product quality.

### Client Shopping Advisor

An AI takes as context the buyer history, the items already in the cart, and the available items and suggestions the best buys

(We also have dark mode ;D )


Besides everything we also have a full functioning Supply Chain platform. The trucks and warehouse have realistic storage limits, the products eventually expire, etc etc.

## How to test it

If you want you can just try it at http://food-oracle.joao-oliveira.org

Login with:

| E-mail | Password |
|---------|-------------|
| `admin@test.com` | `1234` |
| `supplier@test.com` | `1234` |
| `buyer@test.com` | `1234` |
| `driver@test.com` | `1234` |

If you want to build it locally you have a comprehensive makefile on the root directory with the proper commands. 
To make it work you can just do `make all` to build everything and `make db-populate` to add data to database. You also have to add your AWS token and OpenAI token on the .env.
If you're on Windows try running the docker compose commands on the makefile or consider changing ☺

Heres the command list and the relevant links and credentials
