"""
Main database population script for Supply Chain Management System

This script populates the database with sample data including:
- Users (Administrators, Suppliers, Buyers, Truck Drivers)
- Products with pricing and shelf life information
- Warehouses with location and capacity data
- Trucks with driver assignments and locations
- Quotes with PDF documents (ensures at least 3 pending supplier quotes for each product, plus Test Supplier has approved quotes for at least 3 products)
- Product records with quality images
- Orders, trips, and warehouse transfers

Configuration:
- Database and MinIO credentials are loaded from root .env file
- Uses existing environment variables from project root
- Population counts are hardcoded for consistency
